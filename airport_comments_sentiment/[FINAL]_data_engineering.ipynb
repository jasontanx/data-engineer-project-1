About 10,000 troops took part in the exercise. Blissville was the centre of most helicopter activities for the duration of the exercise. At the height of RV81, 73 helicopters were based at Blissville (Kiowas, Twin Hueys, Chinooks from Canada; and Cobras and Chinooks from the US Army). A transportable approach radar (PAR) was installed to serve temporarily as the only approach aid (pre-GPS times!), with precision limits (200 - 1/2). The airport was temporarily given the ident CH3. I was flying the first aircraft (a CH-135 Twin Huey) to flight plan into CH3 under actual IMC, coming from YOY. Shortly after we changed from Boston Center to Moncton Centre, over the Maine-New Brunswick border, the controlled gave us a clearance to Chatham beacon (ident CH), which we promptly refused...

On short final, we were called \"dangerously left of centerline\" by the radar controller.

In a B-52 (wingspan = 185 ft), I agree that it would have been touchy, even on a 300 ft-wide runway; the wing-tip outriggers would have been in the daisies... but in a helicopter??? Anywhere within half a mile of the button is close enough! After \"landing\" on the runway (skid-equipped helicopter) we had to \"roll\" all the way to the high-speed turn-off, about 2/3 of the way down the runway, to air-taxi all the way back behind a follow-me truck to the transient ramp, abeam the threshold of the runway we had shot the approach to, at the south end of the airport.

I heard that Cebu Pacific Air is also flying to Ozamiz in September 2008 by offering Manila flights via Cebu using their ATR 72 plane. The entry of another airline in Ozamiz will definitely boost travel, business and tourism in Misamis Occidental and its neighboring provinces. Works for the improvement of the airport already started in the first quarter of 2008. Expansion of the tarmac, construction of a new passenger arrival building with a luggage carousel/conveyor, installation of the baggage scanner and walk-through detector and car park fencing are almost finished.

I never thought much of those trees or divits in the grass as a student pilot.  A bit of a bump was my launch pad for soft field take offs.  All the little \"Tricks\" you learned flying out of Trinca only made you a better pilot.  Avoiding tall trees wasn't  something that made it tough, it made you FLY! Something a lot of \"pavement\" pilots forget how to do I think. \n",

Look past the rough edges, reach back through time. You can still see and hear all the avid aviation enthusiasts sitting around on the old  picnic table bench, chatting the warm summer days away. To this day, I can walk around the hangers, look in the office, sit on that bench, and get that same warm feeling of camaraderie we all shared in our never ending love for aviation. \n",

Because of thunderstorms along our intended route of flight, we stayed the night at the airport.  BMG has a \"cabin\" at the foot of the control tower that was made available to us for $60 a night.  It was a well-appointed modular home with internet access and computer, a full kitchen and laundry room (both stocked with basic supplies), a comfy living room with a television and several movies available on VHS and DVD.  Plus, they gave us keys to a courtesy car overnight.  As graduates of Indiana University, we used the car to venture into town to visit one of our favorite restaurants that we missed since moving away (there's a great selection of little ethnic restaurants in the area defined by Kirkwood Ave, 4th Street, Dunn, and Grant).

The FBO wasn't willing to brush snow off my plane for any price when I called -- they said they're not allowed to touch the planes (!!) -- but they were fast to give me a forced-air preheat when I had trouble starting in cold weather for departure on Valentine's day (and the line guy, Jeff, was very friendly).  I don't know what, if anything, the preheat cost, because it hasn't shown up on my credit card yet.  Excluding that (and the landing fee, which the airport will charge), my total bill was about $160, including 22 gallons of 100LL and three nights' parking.

I preparared for weeks in advance arranging rental insurance and providing every bit of documentation required of me to ensure a smooth transaction. The checkride went very well and the instructor and I hit it off immediately. I cancelled my flight the next day due to severe turbulence being reported by a 767 at my target altitudes. Perhaps that didn't go over so well since from that point on it was one flub after another. I attempted to arrange an escorted Grand Canyon flight only to have those plans utterly destroyed by miscommunication and a lack of planning by the instructor and staff at First Flight Aviation. When brainstorming ways to salvage the experience we came up with plenty of ideas but nothing was done by the staff to make any of them come to light. Three visits to the airport later and nothing more than a checkride to show for it, I've decided that I needn't bother with trip rentals casually. It's too bad, I had such great plans for this and subsequent trips.\n",

During the warmer months, there are a pair of Piper Pawnee crop dusters operating at South Haven that do not broadcast on the radio.  They are very good at working among the rest of the GA traffic, but it's good to be aware of them.  Transient pilots are most likely to be interested in the new ramp east of the intersection of the two runways - this is where the fuel and terminal building are located.  The ramp at the south end of the field is where the maintenance shop is located.\n",

When I landed there earlier this year the centre of the runway looked fine, but not far from it the gravel looked to be several inches deep and loose.  The worst area was the turn around at the west end, where the gravel was very loose and had some ruts from vehicles.  As long as you watch for and avoid the worst looking areas the runway should be fine when taxiing.  On take off and landing be sure to stay on the centreline where the gravel isn't as loose.  My opinions may also be due to my limited experience flying from gravel strips.\n",

I chose to take off uphill into the wind, with a plan to abort and take off downhill if not airborne and climbing halfway up the hill (it would also make backtracking to the far end quicker if I had to take of downhill and downwind).  The first part of the runway that was relatively flat made all the difference and I was airborne just after the upslope began.  Aircraft type and power effects whether you should take off downhill/downwind or uphill/upwind.  Consider your aircraft's performance and definitely have a go/no-go point in this situation.\n",

            "Comment: Because there's a high ridge just east of the airport, the normal procedure for landing on runway 12 is to do a wide left downwind, then follow the river valley through the town on a slant left base.  Because of a hill SE of the airport, you won't see the runway until you're almost lined up on final.  For departure from runway 30, just reverse the procedure (unless your plane has a very good climb angle) -- instead of trying to outclimb the ridge, make a gentle right turn after takeoff and follow the river valley southeastwards until you're high enough to get over the hills.  Note also that there are trees off both ends of the runway.  If you're in a low-powered plane like a Cherokee or Cessna 172, it might be a good idea to take off when the air is cool (e.g. not midafternoon on a summer day), and to be a fair bit under maximum gross weight (you can top up your fuel at Pembroke [YTA] and Peterborough [YPQ], which are both only 62 nm away and have long paved runways), though the gravel runway is a good length at 2,200 ft.

Among many other things Eddie was the manager of Teterboro from the mid-30's until WWII forced all General Aviation operations west of the Delaware River.  If you zoom in you'll see a large building at the northwest corner of Malcolm and Industrial Ave's ... this is the site of what was in my youth the \"Bendix hangar\", named for the owner of Teterboro for many years, the Bendix Corp. but originally the site of Tony Fokker's US manufacturing facility.  The Borough of Teterbor in which the airport sits in had a population of 25 in the last US census and was known as the Borough of Bendix during the years 1937 through 1943.  A fascinating place.
